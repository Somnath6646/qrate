## Introduction 👋

![COVER.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1656624844815/1EQNK9xrP.png)

qrate enables you to save your links in folder like collections which are synced across all your devices. Also by making collections public you can share them with anyone. qrate enhances the productivity of both you and the person who is benefitting by your publicly available curated collection.

## The Problem 🔒 

The internet is full of resources practically for everything. As a result, on the internet abundance of resources is the problem instead of scarcity. Also the current experience of bookmarking links for future references is either too ugly (using browser’s bookmarks) or too time consuming (using Notion, etc.).

## The Solution *qrate* Offers 🗝

qrate helps users to store all their important links at one place and also share them with the world. It also enables you to store them beautifully that too in minimum time.
*You can also browse others collections divided in several categories ranging from design to finance to science to mere dopamine boosters or search for any collection you want*.

## Challenges Faced ⚒

The biggest challenge faced was extracting the metadata from the links user saves.
Another big challenge was making the app responsive as I was not very great with CSS. However, I overcame all the challenges and learned a lot in the process of making this app.
